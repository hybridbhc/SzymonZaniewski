Data Science Projects
project is presenting prepeartion of Hotel Bookings dataset for further classification algorithms to predict if hotel guest will cancel his reservation. It's aim is to compare results of classification by six algorithms: Random Forest, Decision Trees, Support Vector, XGBoost, Logistic Regression and Multilayer Perceptron. In this project I present multiple techniques to achive this goal.
Project consists of three .ipnb files and folder with datasets needed to acomplish this task.
Order of execution:
1. Data_preparation.ipynb (Data Analysis and preparation)
2. Prediction_A.ipynb (Preparation and classification on a subset data_clear_pkl)
3. Prediction_B.ipynb (Preparation and classification on a subset data_bins.pkl)

Datasets in "data" folder:
A_dataset_results.pkl,
B_dataset_results.pkl
